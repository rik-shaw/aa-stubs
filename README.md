# Android Auto Stubs (for use with de-Googled Android ROMs)

This is a simple consolidation of the necessary "stub apps" for using Android Auto on de-Googled ROMs without installing the proprietary apps from Google. For [iodéOS](https://iode.tech), which includes a spoofed Android Auto stub at the root level, you do *not need to root* your device with Magisk or other, but can directly install these stubs in place of the Google components, using [this guide from the iodé documentation](https://iode.tech/documentation/android-auto/).

For ROMs that do not have Android Auto integration at the root level, you will need to use Magisk or other, following guidance from the [aa4mg project](https://github.com/sn-00-x/aa4mg/).

Credit for the [Maps.apk stub app goes to aa4mg](https://github.com/sn-00-x/aa4mg/), and the [gappsstub.apk and speech-services-stub.apk goes to SolidEva](https://github.com/SolidEva/android-auto-stub/).
